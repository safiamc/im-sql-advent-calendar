-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

WITH user_goal_num AS (
  SELECT
 user_type,
  user_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN goal_status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS comp_user_goals  
FROM user_goals
GROUP BY user_type, user_id
  )
SELECT
 user_type,
  AVG(comp_user_goals) as avg_comp_goals
FROM user_goal_num
GROUP BY user_type
