-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

WITH resort_annual_snowfall AS (
  SELECT
    resort_name,
    SUM(snowfall_inches) AS snowfall_inches
  FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
  GROUP BY resort_id
)

SELECT
  resort_name,
  ntile(4) over (order by snowfall_inches DESC) AS quartile
FROM resort_annual_snowfall
