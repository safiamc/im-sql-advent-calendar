-- Title: Winter Market Sweater Search
-- Difficulty: medium
--
-- Question:
-- At the winter market, Cindy Lou is browsing the clothing inventory and wants to find all items with "sweater" in their name. But the challenge is the color and item columns have inconsistent capitalization. Can you write a query to return only the sweater names and their cleaned-up colors.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: winter_clothing
--   item_id: INT
--   item_name: VARCHAR
--   color: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
  item_name,
  UPPER(SUBSTRING(color,1,1)) || LOWER(SUBSTRING(color,2)) AS color_cleaned
FROM winter_clothing
WHERE LOWER(item_name) LIKE '%sweater%'
