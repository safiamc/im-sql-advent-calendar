-- Over the 12 days of her data challenge, Data Dawn tracked her daily quiz scores across different subjects. Can you find each subject's first and last recorded score to see how much she improved?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

WITH last_scores AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
  subject,
  FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date DESC) AS last_score
FROM daily_quiz_scores
  ),

first_scores AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
  subject,
  FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date) AS first_score
FROM daily_quiz_scores
)

SELECT
  f.subject,
  f.first_score,
  l.last_score
FROM first_scores AS f
LEFT JOIN last_scores AS l on l.subject = f.subject
